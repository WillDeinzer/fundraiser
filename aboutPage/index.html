            <p class="reason">My brother has autism, so I decided to support The Summer Center 
            to thank them for all they have done for him throughout his life.
            They provided assistance with speech, social skills, and job searching, 
            and they were especially helpful during the pandemic. My piano repertoire grew
            significantly during COVID, so I chose to give a concert for the fundraiser
            to make up for the lost performance opportunities. I have selected all
            of my favorite pieces for this recital, and I hope you enjoy the program.
            Thank you for your interest!
